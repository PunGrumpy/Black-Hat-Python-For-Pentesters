## Computer Forensics

- Forensics is the art of applying science to law
    - Computer forensics is the analysis of computer data for possible use in civil or criminal cases
- Many artifacts are left on computers due to file operations
    - Metadata about file use, e.g. creation date, last modified, modified by, etc.
    - Metadata embedded within a file, e.g. author, date, geolocation, etc.
    - System and network logs

## Windows Registry

- The winreg library provides access to the Windows Registry
- Registry handle objects wrap HKEY objects and automatically close connections when destroyed
- Functions available to create, open, close, query, enumerate, et al. keys and values
- Pre-defined objects
    - Constants, e.g. HKEY_CURRENT_USER
    - Access rights, e.g. KEY_ALL_ACCESS
    - Value types, e.g. REG_RESOURCE_LIST

## Application Artifacts

- Similar to metadata, application artifacts provide information about software use, user activity, and file storage, in the case of online repositories
- In software development, artifacts are by-products of the development process
    - Diagrams
    - Use cases
    - UML models
- Databases (covered in the next section) frequently store many artifacts related to application use
    - Lightweight DB like SQLite commonly included with software to manage data storage and access by an application
- Other artifact repositories include property lists (plists) and text logs
