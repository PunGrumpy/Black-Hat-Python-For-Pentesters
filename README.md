# Black Hat: Python For Pentesters

Learn how to write python scripts in order to perform pentesting on Windows and Linux Machines

## Pentestation Testing

- Pentesting evaluates system and network security
- Identifies vulnerabilities and the potential for exploit by malicious parties
- Only performed on authorized systems; formal, written permission should be obtainedfor legal reasons

## Pentesting Methodology

- Reconnaissance: gathering information about target
- Scanning/Footprinting: technical assessment of potential openings
- Gaining Access: utilize exploits to enter system
- Maintain Access: ensure persistent connection to target for data gathering and extraction
- Covering Tracks: hide traces that an attack occurred

## Python Pentesting

- Provieds the ability to craft attacks that don't have an existing signature
- Automates a variety of tasks, such as device enumeration
- Integrates well with existing tools, e.g. python-nmap
- General purpose nature expands use beyond pentesting and hacking, such as data analysis, text editing, etc.
