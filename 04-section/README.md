## Password Cracking Concepts

- Password cracking is the art and science of decrypting passwords
- Technically, passwords are hashed with a one-way algorithm
- Cracking is identifying what password creates a particular hash digest
- Password dumps are useful because they provide a large database of passwords and digests to start with

## Types of Attacks

- Dictionary attack: matching word dictionaries to passwords
- Brute force attack: work through all possible combinations
- Rainbow tables: pre-calculate password hash digests
- Phishing/social engineering/shoulder surfing: get someone to provide their password to you
- Keylogger: capture data directly from keyboard
- Spidering: create word list based on web crawl of corporate literature
- Guessing: focused brute force, e.g. "FootBallFan#1 "

## Pre-Computed Wordlists

- Pre-hash all words in a file
- Perform a binary tree search of sorted index of digests
- Best used with a compiled language doing the processor-intensive operations

## Brute Force

- Labor intensive (in terms of processing power)
- Multi-threaded/multi-processor parallelization is best option
- Alternative to vanilla Python best: Python w/ compiled language, Cython, PyPy, Jython, IronPython, etc.

## Rainbow Tables

- Pre-calculated rainbow tables are available (http://freerainbowtables.com/)
- Python wrapper around compiled language for best results
    - Alternatives include PyPy and Cython

## Unix Passwords

- Attacks default UNIX OS hashing
- Requires `user:password` file and plain-text password file
- Generates rainbow table in memory from plain-text passwords and determines if there is a match

## ZIP file Passwords

- Attacks default ZIP file passwords
- Simple attack that checks to see if a password from a list can open a ZIP file
