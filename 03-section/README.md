## Target Research

- Briefly touched on last section, web recon tells you about your target
- Web sites have useful information, often hidden in the source code
    - Web scraping can capture data for later analysis, which reduces the likelihood of prior detection
    - Data gathered includes links to internal/external sites, images, emails, etc.
- We will focus on websites, but Python can also automate Internet searching, social
media queries, and similar research

## Web Scraping

- Multiple tools are available, as well as online services
- Considerations
- Anonymizing through proxy servers

## Phishing
