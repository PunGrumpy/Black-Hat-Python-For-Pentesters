## Why Network Recon?

- Network recon tells you a lot about your target
    - Establishes a baseline to plan your attack and determine the necessary tools
    - Describes the network topology, system structure, and operating systems an possible applications
- Knowing this information can provide clues as to possible vulnerabilities due to version and software type
- Internet research provides additional clues about the target 
    - List of email addresses and how email names are formatted
    - Hierarchy and organization of target personnel
    - Vendors and customers
    - Possible backdoors via third-party maintenance and support

## Things to Consider

- Identify the network topology
- Find the operating system types of discovered hosts
- Locate open ports and network services in a target environment.
- Find the network addresses of live hosts, firewalls, routers, etc.
- Consider a list of potential vulnerabilities.
- Don't use tools that make a lot of noise; it can potentially crash the host or even make the host aware of our presence

## Python Port Scanner

- Utilizes Low-level sockets to interface with TCP and UDP protocols
- Most connections use TCP, as it is connection-oriented and ensures data packets are received
- UDP is connectionless, so it is commonly used in VoIP, video streaming, and other applications where dropped packets is tolerable

## Banner Grabbing

- Sends a request to the target 
- The returned string may provide information about the target
- Operating system
- Services running
- Version numbers

## Import Nmap

- Why roll your own when you can use pre-made tools?
- Utilizes the power of nmap with the control of Python
