## [String Formatting](./string-formatting/)

String formatting alllows Python to generate text that includes a variety of generated values, such as numbers, the results of functions or methods, calculations, etc. They are a fundamental part of programming, as text is a primary way to inform the user of what the program is doing.

### Traditional Formatting

- Derived from the C language
- Requires use of symbols to designed the type of object to insert into the text string
- Can be limiting compared to the new formats

### Modern Formatting

- Doesn't require symbols matching; Python knows how to convert values to correct type
- Multiple options
    - By default position
    - By numbered position
    - By name
    - F-strings

## [Dictionaries](./dictionaries/)

- Also known as associative arrays, dictionaries map keys to values
    - Signified by curly braces `{}`
    - Created in the form of `{key:value}` pairs
    - Mutiple pairs are separated by commas, like this `{key1:value1, key2:value2}`
- Keys can be any immutable (non-changing) type; values can be anything, even other dictionaries
- Allow values to be retrieved by calling their associated key
- Prior **Python 3.7**, dictionaries entries were unordered, so no guarantee in the sequence that pairs were stored

## [Lists](./lists/)

- Similar to arrays in other languages; lists contain a sequence of comma-separated objects
    - Signified by square brackets `[]`
- The most commonly used Python data structure
- Stored objects are identified by an index value, indicating their position within the sequence
    - Index values start counting at 0, so a desired object is index is `n+1`
- String are specialized lists
- All sequences have wide variety of built-in functions
- Lists are mutable; they can be modified in-place

## [Tuple](./tuples/)

- Similar to lists, except they are immutable
    - Signified by commas separating values (required)
    - Parentheses are often used to make it easier to identify tuples, but are not required
- Used when a sequence shouldn't change
    - Useful for ensuring accidental changes aren't made
- Commonly used for sequence unpacking

## [Sets](./sets/)

- Unordered collections of objects
    - Signified by curly braces `{}`, like dictionaries but with only signle values, no `key:value` pairs
- Commonly used for testing object membership and removing duplicates
- Some mathematical operations are supported (union, intersection, difference, etc.)

## [Files](./files/)

- The `open()` function is the primary way to access files, both for reading and writing
    - It defaults to read-only for data protection
    - Binary files can be opened with this function call, simply by adding "rb", "wb", etc.
    - Best practice: use with open() vs. just open(), as this will automatically close the file when it is no longer in use
- The libraries `shutil` and `os` provide high-level operations on files, much like shell commands
    - Examples include copying files, moving files, changing ownership, etc.

### [Data Serialization](./README.md#data-serialization)

- Required to convert Python objects to byte streams suitable for network transfer
- The built-in library `pickle` is the primary Python tool for data serialization
    - `pickle` is not secure against data errors, whether accidental or on purpose

## Procedural VS Object-Oriented Programming

### Procedural Programming

- Uses functions to "break out" of normal logic flow
- Improves code reusability and reduces "spaghetti code"

### [Object-Oriented Programming](./oop/)

- Uses methods; same purpose as functions but tied to a particular object
- Separate instances can be created with the same parameters and methods
- Allows better reuse of code, particularly through inheritance

### Python can use both procedural and object-oriented programming within the same program
